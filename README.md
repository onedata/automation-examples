# Automation examples

Examples of automation lambdas and workflow schemes that can be used in Onedata.

This repository serves two purposes:

1. Provides examples to easily get started with creating your lambdas and workflows.
2. Provides ready-to-use JSON dumps of workflow schemes that can be loaded
   into an automation inventory; just download a JSON of the desired workflow
   scheme onto your disk and use the "Upload JSON" action in the workflows tab.
